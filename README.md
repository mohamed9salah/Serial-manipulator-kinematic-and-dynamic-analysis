# Serial-manipulator-kinematic-and-dynamic-analysis-MATLAB
This repository contains a comprehensive kinematic and dynamic analysis for serial manipulators. The project covers various scenarios, including the kinematic study of a single serial manipulator with 6 links and two manipulators each with 6 links. Additionally, it includes generalized code for analyzing manipulators with any number of links (𝑛) and code for multi-manipulator systems involving 𝑛 links and 𝑝 manipulators. The analysis and code are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different configurations, making it a valuable resource for those studying or working with robotic manipulators. The project is implemented in MATLAB, and users can easily run the provided scripts to perform the desired analyses.
